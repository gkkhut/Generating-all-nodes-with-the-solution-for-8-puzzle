# Generating-all-nodes-with-the-solution-for-8-puzzle

Implementation of tree generation algorithm to generate nodes for 8-Puzzle and search algorithm to find the solution for any given state.

MATLAB program is included in the code folder. 
The program generates the total of 100000 Nodes of the input matrice i.e.
[2 8 3;1 6 4;7 0 5].

Steps to run the program:

1) Open MATLAB and open [main.m] file which is in the Code folder.
2) Make sure all the files are in the code directory.
3) Change the working directory to Code folder.
4) Run the main program.
5) Output matrices are available at the variable workspace - cset - nodes and nodesinfo.
6) Output is also included in Output folder - (Nodes and Nodesinfo)
